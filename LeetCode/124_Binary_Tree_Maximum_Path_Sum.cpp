/*
 Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.
 
 For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path does not need to go through the root.
 
 For example:
 Given the below binary tree,
 
  1
 / \
2   3
 
Return 6.
